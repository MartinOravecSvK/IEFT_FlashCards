### Lecture 1: Microeconomic Principles

#### Q1: What does microeconomics study?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Microeconomics studies the behavior of individuals and businesses and how decisions are made based on the allocation of limited resources.
</details>

#### Q2: What is the law of supply and demand?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The law of supply and demand states that in a competitive market, the price of a product adjusts until the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, reaching equilibrium.
</details>

#### Q3: What happens when there is excess demand in a market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  When demand exceeds supply, prices rise, moving the market toward equilibrium.
</details>

#### Q4: What is consumer surplus?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Consumer surplus is the value consumers receive from a product in excess of the price they pay for it, represented by the area under the demand curve and above the market price.
</details>

#### Q5: What is producer surplus?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Producer surplus is the price producers receive for a good minus their minimum acceptable price, summed over the quantity sold. It is the area above the supply curve and below the market price.
</details>

#### Q6: What are fixed and variable costs?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Fixed costs: Costs that do not vary with production levels (e.g., rent).  
  - Variable costs: Costs that change with production levels (e.g., raw materials).  
</details>

#### Q7: What is marginal cost?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of a good. It is calculated as the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity produced.
</details>

#### Q8: What is diminishing marginal utility?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Diminishing marginal utility occurs when each additional unit of a good consumed provides less benefit than the previous one.
</details>

#### Q9: How does price elasticity of demand differ for elastic and inelastic goods?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Elastic goods: Small price changes result in large changes in quantity demanded.  
  - Inelastic goods: Large price changes result in small changes in quantity demanded.  
</details>

#### Q10: What is the equilibrium point in a competitive market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The equilibrium point is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, maximizing total consumer and producer surplus.
</details>

#### Q11: How does a monopoly differ from a competitive market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  In a monopoly, one firm dominates the market and sets prices, while in a competitive market, firms are price takers and must sell at market price.
</details>

#### Q12: What causes shifts in supply or demand?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Shifts in supply or demand occur when external factors change, such as production costs, consumer preferences, or geopolitical events, altering the price-quantity relationship.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  1. English Auction: Open ascending-price auction.  
  2. Dutch Auction: Open descending-price auction.  
  3. First-Price Sealed Bid: Highest bidder wins and pays their bid.  
  4. Second-Price Sealed Bid (Vickrey Auction): Highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.  
</details>

#### Q2: What is the difference between private and interdependent values in auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - **Private Values**: Each bidder knows their valuation independently of others (e.g., personal use items).  
  - **Interdependent Values**: Bidders’ valuations are influenced by information others might have (e.g., assets for resale).  
</details>

#### Q3: What is strategic equivalence in auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Strategic equivalence occurs when every strategy in one auction has a corresponding strategy in another, leading to identical outcomes (e.g., Dutch and First-Price Sealed Bid).  
</details>

#### Q4: Why are English and Vickrey auctions incentive compatible?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Both auctions encourage bidders to bid their true value because it is the optimal strategy for maximizing their surplus.  
</details>

#### Q5: What is the Revenue Equivalence Theorem?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The theorem states that under certain conditions (private values, risk neutrality, independent identically distributed values), all standard auction formats yield the same expected revenue to the seller.  
</details>

#### Q6: Why might revenue differ in practice despite the Revenue Equivalence Theorem?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Bidders may be risk-averse, leading to higher bids in First-Price Sealed Bid auctions.  
  - Values may be interdependent, making open auctions more profitable due to shared information.  
</details>

#### Q7: What is the main drawback of open auctions compared to sealed bids?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Open auctions are more susceptible to collusion since bidders can observe each other’s strategies and signal.  
</details>

#### Q8: How do time limits affect eBay-style auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Time limits encourage "sniping," where bidders place last-minute bids to avoid being outbid, potentially reducing optimal bidding behavior.  
</details>

#### Q9: What solution did eBay introduce to address last-minute sniping?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  eBay introduced "proxy bidding," allowing users to enter their maximum bid upfront, with the system incrementally bidding on their behalf.  
</details>

#### Q10: How do Google Ads auctions differ from traditional auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Google Ads auctions use a second-price approach, but incorporate "quality scores" for ads, affecting the final bid price and ranking.  
</details>

#### Q11: What is a reverse auction?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  A reverse auction has suppliers competing to offer the lowest price for a contract, with the lowest bidder winning.  
</details>

#### Q12: What is a Continuous Double Auction (CDA)?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  A CDA allows buyers and sellers to post bids and offers continuously, facilitating dynamic price discovery. This mechanism underpins financial markets.
