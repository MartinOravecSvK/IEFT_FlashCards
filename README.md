### Q7: What is Chris Anderson's concept of "The Long Tail"?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The Long Tail describes how online markets make niche products profitable by reducing costs and leveraging infinite "shelf space." Success comes from making everything available, reducing prices, and helping users find items.
</details>

### Q8: What criticism exists regarding "The Long Tail"?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Critics like Anita Elberse argue that the web amplifies the importance of blockbusters, questioning whether niche products significantly impact overall sales.
</details>

### Q9: What is Clayton Christensen’s concept of "Disruptive Innovation"?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Disruptive innovations are simpler, cheaper alternatives that initially perform worse than existing products but improve over time, eventually overtaking established markets.
</details>

### Q10: What is "The Innovator's Dilemma"?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Successful companies focus on improving existing products for high-margin markets, ignoring disruptive technologies, which later dominate and lead to the incumbents' decline.
</details>

### Q11: What are the three styles of innovation described in "Seeing What’s Next"?  
<details>

## General Concepts

### Q17: What are positive feedback and network externalities?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Positive feedback occurs when a product's popularity enhances its value (e.g., more users attract even more users). Network externalities describe the increasing utility of a product as its user base grows.
</details>

### Q18: Why is shelf space important in traditional retail compared to online markets?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Traditional retail limits inventory to high-margin, high-volume products due to physical constraints. Online markets benefit from virtually unlimited "shelf space," allowing niche products to be stocked profitably.

</details>

### Q21: What are power-law distributions, and how do they relate to internet economics?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Power-law distributions show that a small number of products or users dominate in popularity or revenue (e.g., top 1% of songs streamed). This drives strategies for "head" and "tail" markets.
</details>

### Q22: Why is "infinite shelf space" a game-changer for online retailers?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Infinite shelf space allows online retailers to stock and sell niche products profitably, unlike physical stores constrained by space.
</details>

### Q23: What are some criticisms of disruptive innovation theory?

### Lecture 1: Microeconomic Principles

#### Q1: What does microeconomics study?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Microeconomics studies the behavior of individuals and businesses and how decisions are made based on the allocation of limited resources.
</details>

#### Q2: What is the law of supply and demand?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The law of supply and demand states that in a competitive market, the price of a product adjusts until the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, reaching equilibrium.
</details>

#### Q3: What happens when there is excess demand in a market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  When demand exceeds supply, prices rise, moving the market toward equilibrium.
</details>

#### Q4: What is consumer surplus?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Consumer surplus is the value consumers receive from a product in excess of the price they pay for it, represented by the area under the demand curve and above the market price.
</details>

#### Q5: What is producer surplus?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Producer surplus is the price producers receive for a good minus their minimum acceptable price, summed over the quantity sold. It is the area above the supply curve and below the market price.
</details>

#### Q6: What are fixed and variable costs?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Fixed costs: Costs that do not vary with production levels (e.g., rent).  
  - Variable costs: Costs that change with production levels (e.g., raw materials).  
</details>

#### Q7: What is marginal cost?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Marginal cost is the cost of producing one additional unit of a good. It is calculated as the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity produced.
</details>

#### Q8: What is diminishing marginal utility?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Diminishing marginal utility occurs when each additional unit of a good consumed provides less benefit than the previous one.
</details>

#### Q9: How does price elasticity of demand differ for elastic and inelastic goods?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Elastic goods: Small price changes result in large changes in quantity demanded.  
  - Inelastic goods: Large price changes result in small changes in quantity demanded.  
</details>

#### Q10: What is the equilibrium point in a competitive market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The equilibrium point is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, maximizing total consumer and producer surplus.
</details>

#### Q11: How does a monopoly differ from a competitive market?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  In a monopoly, one firm dominates the market and sets prices, while in a competitive market, firms are price takers and must sell at market price.
</details>

#### Q12: What causes shifts in supply or demand?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Shifts in supply or demand occur when external factors change, such as production costs, consumer preferences, or geopolitical events, altering the price-quantity relationship.
</details>

### Lecture 2: Auction Principles

#### Q1: What are the four common auction types?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  1. English Auction: Open ascending-price auction.  
  2. Dutch Auction: Open descending-price auction.  
  3. First-Price Sealed Bid: Highest bidder wins and pays their bid.  
  4. Second-Price Sealed Bid (Vickrey Auction): Highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.  
</details>

#### Q2: What is the difference between private and interdependent values in auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - **Private Values**: Each bidder knows their valuation independently of others (e.g., personal use items).  
  - **Interdependent Values**: Bidders’ valuations are influenced by information others might have (e.g., assets for resale).  
</details>

#### Q3: What is strategic equivalence in auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Strategic equivalence occurs when every strategy in one auction has a corresponding strategy in another, leading to identical outcomes (e.g., Dutch and First-Price Sealed Bid).  
</details>

#### Q4: Why are English and Vickrey auctions incentive compatible?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Both auctions encourage bidders to bid their true value because it is the optimal strategy for maximizing their surplus.  
</details>

#### Q5: What is the Revenue Equivalence Theorem?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  The theorem states that under certain conditions (private values, risk neutrality, independent identically distributed values), all standard auction formats yield the same expected revenue to the seller.  
</details>

#### Q6: Why might revenue differ in practice despite the Revenue Equivalence Theorem?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  - Bidders may be risk-averse, leading to higher bids in First-Price Sealed Bid auctions.  
  - Values may be interdependent, making open auctions more profitable due to shared information.  
</details>

#### Q7: What is the main drawback of open auctions compared to sealed bids?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Open auctions are more susceptible to collusion since bidders can observe each other’s strategies and signal.  
</details>

#### Q8: How do time limits affect eBay-style auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Time limits encourage "sniping," where bidders place last-minute bids to avoid being outbid, potentially reducing optimal bidding behavior.  
</details>

#### Q9: What solution did eBay introduce to address last-minute sniping?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  eBay introduced "proxy bidding," allowing users to enter their maximum bid upfront, with the system incrementally bidding on their behalf.  
</details>

#### Q10: How do Google Ads auctions differ from traditional auctions?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  Google Ads auctions use a second-price approach, but incorporate "quality scores" for ads, affecting the final bid price and ranking.  
</details>

#### Q11: What is a reverse auction?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  A reverse auction has suppliers competing to offer the lowest price for a contract, with the lowest bidder winning.  
</details>

#### Q12: What is a Continuous Double Auction (CDA)?  
<details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  A CDA allows buyers and sellers to post bids and offers continuously, facilitating dynamic price discovery. This mechanism underpins financial markets.
